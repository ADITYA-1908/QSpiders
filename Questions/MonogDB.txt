Q1) What is a Database Driver?

Ans: A database driver is a software component that allows an application to interact with a specific DBMS.
It acts as a bridge between the application and the database, making communication and data exchange standardized and easier.

Q2) What is ORM?

Ans: ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.
It is a software technique that acts as an abstraction layer between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language.
ORM helps programmers work with data without manually writing complex SQL queries.
It allows developers to use object-oriented structures to interact with the database.

Advantages of ORM:

Increases productivity by removing boilerplate code

Improves application design

Code reusability

Easier to maintain

Reduces development cost

Q3) What is ODM?

Ans: ODM stands for Object Document Mapper.
It is a tool that allows users to interact with a MongoDB database using JavaScript objects.

Q4) What is Mongoose ODM?

Ans: Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and translates objects in code into documents stored in MongoDB.

Q5) What is a Schema in Mongoose?

Ans: A Mongoose schema defines the structure and properties of documents in a MongoDB collection.
A schema is used to define expected fields, their types, default values, constraints, and indexes.
A compiled version of a schema is called a Model.

Q6) What is a Model in Mongoose?

Ans: A Mongoose model is a wrapper around a schema.
While a schema defines the structure, default values, and validators, the model provides the interface to the database for:

Creating

Reading

Updating

Deleting

Querying records
